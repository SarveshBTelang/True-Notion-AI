### Note: 

---

This folder contains the source code for data ingestion and processing. It includes loading data, splitting it into chunks, generating vector embeddings, and storing them in a vectorstore.

Files prefixed with "template" are consolidated versions of data_loader.py and process.py. They serve as interchangeable templates for vector embedding pipelines.
To use a template, simply replace references to data_loader and process in your main script with the desired template.py file.

These templates are designed to make it easy to switch between different vectorstore implementationsâ€”whether you're embedding text offline, using models hosted on the web, or relying on serverless APIs.
